## Features

- Engaging and context-aware conversations. DEEPSEEK-
- Ability to handle multiple user inputs and maintain conversation history.
- Customizable settings for model parameters and behavior.
- Orginalmodel.txt was able to at one point autoload a older model of deepseek. However, This verison is able in some degree. tokenize the model. train it. And maybe add in orginal data sets. However if you don't have 48gb ram your page file may need increasing. However, you can use the old model. And I will watch it to include a smaller deepseek for now. You just don't want to tokenize out. otherwise you have to conform to the stucture of the json request and build it out more. but for linux the directory would be "./file/location/of/deepseek"
